#' Return the memory address of an object
#' 
#' Return the memory address of an object after recursively searching for the object in all the environments defined
#' in a specified environment or in all the environments defined in the whole workspace.
#' 
#' @param obj object whose memory address is requested. It can be given as a variable name or an expression.
#' Strings representing object names are not interpreted and return NULL.
#' @param envir environment where the object should be searched for. All parent environments of
#' \code{envir} are searched as well. Defaults to \code{NULL} which means that it should be searched in the
#' whole workspace (including packages and user-defined environments).
#' @param envmap data frame containing a lookup table with name-address pairs of environment names and
#' addresses to be used when searching for object \code{obj}. Defaults to NULL which means that the
#' lookup table is constructed on the fly with the environments defined in the \code{envir} environment
#' --if not NULL--, or in the whole workspace if \code{envir=NULL}.
#' See the details section for more information on its structure.
#' @param n number of levels to go up from the calling function environment to resolve the name
#' of \code{obj}. It defaults to 0 which implies the calling environment.
#' @param include_functions whether to include funtion execution environments as environments where the object
#' is searched for. Set this flag to \code{TRUE} with caution because there may be several functions where the
#' same object is defined, for instance functions that are called as part of the object searching process!
#'
#' @details
#' The object is first searched recursively in all environments defined in the specified environment (if any),
#' by calling \code{obj_find}.
#' If no environment is specified, the object is searched recursively in the whole workspace by calling
#' that same function \code{obj_find}.
#' 
#' The memory address is then retrieved for every object found in those environments having the same name
#' as the given object \code{obj}.
#' 
#' Strings return \code{NULL} but strings can be the result of an expression passed as argument to this function.
#' In that case, the string is interpreted as an object and its memory address is returned if the object exists.
#' 
#' If \code{envmap} is passed it should be a data frame providing an address-name pair lookup table
#' of environments and should contain at least the following columns:
#' \itemize{
#' \item{\code{location}} for user-defined environments, the name of the environment where the environment
#' is located; otherwise \code{NA}.
#' \item{\code{pathname}} the full \emph{environment path} to reach the environment separated by \code{$}
#' (e.g. \code{"env1$env$envx"})
#' \item{\code{address}} the 16-digit memory address of the environment given in \code{pathname} enclosed
#' in < > (e.g. \code{"<0000000007DCFB38>"})
#' }
#' This is useful for speedup purposes, in case several calls to this function will be done
#' under the same environment space.
#' Such \code{envmap} data frame can be created by calling \link{get_env_names}.
#' Use this parameter with care, as the matrix passed may not correspond to the actual mapping of existing
#' environments to their addresses and in that case results may be different from those expected.
#' 
#' @return The 16-digit memory address of the input object given as a string enclosed in <>
#' (e.g. \code{"<0000000005E90988>"}), or NULL under any of the following situations:
#' \itemize{
#' \item the object is \code{NULL}, \code{NA}, or a string, or any other object whose memory address changes every
#' time the object is referred to (for instance for \code{alist[1]} --as opposed to \code{alist[[1]]}--
#' where \code{alist} is a list.
#' \item the object is a constant (e.g. \code{TRUE}, \code{3}, etc.)
#' \item the object does not exist in the given environment.
#' \item the object is an expression that cannot be evaluated in the given environment.
#' }
#' 
#' Note that for the last case, although constants have a memory address, this address is meaningless as
#' it changes with every invocation of the function. For instance, running
#' envnames:::address(3) several times will show a different memory address each time, and that is why
#' \code{get_obj_address} returns NULL in those cases.
#' 
#' When \code{envir=NULL} (the default) or when an object exists in several environments,
#' the memory address is returned for all of the environments where the object is found. In that case, the addresses are
#' stored in an array whose names attribute shows the environments where the object is found.
#' 
#' @examples
#' env1 = new.env()
#' env1$x = 3                       # x defined in environment 'env1'
#' x = 4                            # x defined in the Global Environment
#' get_obj_address(env1$x)          # returns the memory address of the object 'x' defined in the 'env1' environment
#' get_obj_address(x, envir=env1)   # same as above
#' get_obj_address(x)               # Searches for object 'x' everywhere in the workspace and
#'                                  # returns a named array with the memory address of all its occurrences,
#'                                  # where the names are the names of the environments where x was found.
#' 
#' # Memory addresses of objects whose names are stored in an array and retrieved using sapply()
#' env1$y <- 2;
#' objects <- c("x", "y")
#' sapply(objects, FUN=get_obj_address, envir=env1)	# Note that the address of object "x" is the same as the one returned above by get_obj_address(x, envir=env1)
#' 
#' # Memory address of elements of a list
#' alist <- list("x")
#' get_obj_address(alist[[1]])      # memory address of object 'x'
#' get_obj_address(alist[1])        # NULL because alist[1] has a memory address that changes every time alist[1] is referred to.

				## It's strange that the latter does not work because eval() first evaluates obj in the calling environment

				## in the environment specified in envir. But, despite this I get the error message that 'env9'
				## is not found when envir is not the Global Environment!
				## We can neither use evalq() because evalq() prevents 'obj' from being evaluated in the
				## current execution environment and in that case the address() function would be returning
				## the memory address of the local variable 'obj', not of the variable referenced by 'obj'!  
				
				## NOTE also that eval() presumably looks for the object recursively in all parent environments
				## if it is not found in the 'envir' environment, so in principle it does the same thing that
				## exists() does when inherits=TRUE, and we should be ok here in that eval() should not give an
				## error if exists() returned TRUE.
